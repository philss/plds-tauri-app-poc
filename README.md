# Tauri sample app

In order to run you need first to install [`plds`](https://github.com/phoenixframework/plds)
and then run: `npm run tauri dev`.

Currently only runs on Linux, with `asdf` installed.
But if you want to run on MacOs or Windows, just build a "wrapper" for it
and place in the `src-tauri/bin` dir with execution permissions.
